# myls - A similar command to ls

myls is a custom command that can be used instead of ls.    
I have implemented myls with these options-  
1. -a  
2. -l  
3. -la or -al  or -a -l or -l -a (all of these options interpret both of -a and -l.)  
# How To Use  
### To use the command just type in terminal like ls -  
```
 myls  
 myls -a  
 myls -l  
 myls -al  
```
